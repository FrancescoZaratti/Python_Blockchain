## Python Blockchain 🐍
Welcome to the **Python blockchain project**. 🧑🏻‍💻\
In this small project, I create a **working blockchain** using the python language.\
\
In the repository you will find the **python file** with the whole script and a **.puml file** with a graphic explaining how blockchain technology works.
